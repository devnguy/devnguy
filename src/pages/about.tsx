    <p>
      Hi, I’m Devin. Friends call me Dev. Coworkers also call me a dev. I
      currently work as an associate engineer doing full stack web development.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m passionate about technologies that make our lives easier. I love
      tinkering with tools and libraries that eventually* increase my
      productivity.
    </p>
    <p>
      My free time is usually spent rewatching The Office for the nth time,
      waiting for mechanical keyboard parts to come in, and finding music that
      sounds similar to the band Alvvays.
